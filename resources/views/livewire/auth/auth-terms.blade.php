    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Lost & Found System. This System provides a platform for users to report lost items, claim found items, and facilitate their return. By accessing or using the System, you agree to comply with and be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must refrain from using the System.</p>

    <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>As a user of the System, you agree to the following responsibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accuracy of Information:</strong> You must provide accurate, complete, and truthful information when reporting lost or found items. False or misleading information may result in the suspension of your account or other actions.</li>
      <li><strong>Reporting Found Items:</strong> If you find an item, you are encouraged to report it promptly and provide as much detail as possible, including location, time found, and a description of the item.</li>
      <li><strong>Claiming Lost Items:</strong> When claiming a found item, you must present sufficient evidence or details that reasonably prove your ownership of the item.</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> You must ensure that your use of the System complies with all applicable laws and regulations. Engaging in any illegal or unauthorized activities is strictly prohibited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. System Usage</h2>
    <p>The System allows users to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Report Lost Items:</strong> Users can submit details of items they have lost, including the date, location, and item description.</li>
      <li><strong>Report Found Items:</strong> Users can report items they have found and are willing to assist in returning to the rightful owner.</li>
      <li><strong>View Matched Items:</strong> The System will attempt to match reported lost items with found items based on provided descriptions.</li>
      <li><strong>Return Process:</strong> When an item is matched, the System may facilitate communication between the finder and the owner to arrange the return of the item.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Item Matching and Ownership</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Item Matching:</strong> The System uses algorithms and manual input to match lost items with found items based on user-provided details. However, this matching process is not guaranteed to be 100% accurate, and users are encouraged to verify the ownership of items independently.</li>
      <li><strong>Ownership Verification:</strong> The responsibility to verify the ownership of any item rests solely with the users. The System does not verify the accuracy of claims and is not responsible for any disputes that arise from the claiming of items.</li>
      <li><strong>Item Return:</strong> If a match is found, users must coordinate with each other to facilitate the return of the item. The System does not directly handle the transfer of items and is not liable for any complications during the return process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Actions</h2>
    <p>The following activities are strictly prohibited on the System:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Misrepresentation:</strong> Providing false, misleading, or incomplete information in any report or communication.</li>
      <li><strong>Spam and Fraud:</strong> Posting repetitive, irrelevant, or fraudulent reports in an attempt to disrupt the functionality of the System or deceive other users.</li>
      <li><strong>Offensive or Inappropriate Content:</strong> Users must refrain from posting offensive, inappropriate, or harmful content, including images or language that violates common decency or the rights of others.</li>
      <li><strong>Unauthorized Use:</strong> Attempting to access the System for any purpose other than reporting and claiming lost or found items is strictly prohibited. Unauthorized use includes hacking, scraping, or reverse engineering the System.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Guarantees:</strong> The System is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. We do not guarantee the success of locating lost items or returning found items.</li>
      <li><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> Users are solely responsible for the information they provide and the actions they take while using the System. We are not liable for any loss or damage that may occur due to inaccurate reports or failure to return items.</li>
      <li><strong>Indirect Damages:</strong> We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the System, including but not limited to loss of data, lost items, or reputational damage.</li>
      <li><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> In no event shall our liability exceed the total amount of any fees paid (if applicable) by you for accessing or using the System.</li>
    </ul>
